# Palette - Color Palette Studio

This project provides a studio for viewing and copying color palettes. This document outlines the recent changes made to implement a single-click copy functionality for each palette.

## Implemented Feature: Single-Click Palette Copy

Each color palette displayed on the page now includes a "Copy" button. Clicking this button will copy the palette's color values to your clipboard in a predefined format. The button will temporarily change to "Copied!" and display a checkmark icon to indicate successful copying.

### Copy Format

When you click the "Copy" button, the following format will be copied to your clipboard:

```
Primary: #000000
Secondary: #0a0a0a
Tertiary: #1a1a1a
Text: #8a8a8a
Accent: #00d4ff
```
(Note: The hex codes will correspond to the actual colors of the palette you copied.)

## How to Verify the Functionality

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    cd Palette
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by `npm run dev` (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
3.  **Click a "Copy" button:** Locate any color palette card and click the "Copy" button associated with it.
4.  **Paste and verify:** Open a text editor or any application where you can paste text (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, a new browser tab's address bar) and paste the content from your clipboard. You should see the color palette details in the specified format.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made in `app/page.tsx`:

*   **Import `ClipboardCopy` icon:** The `ClipboardCopy` icon from `lucide-react` was added to the imports.
*   **`copiedPaletteName` state:** A new state variable `copiedPaletteName` was introduced to manage the visual feedback (changing the button text to "Copied!").
*   **`handleCopyPalette` function:** A new function `handleCopyPalette` was created to:
    *   Prevent event propagation to the parent `Card` component.
    *   Format the palette's color values into the desired string format.
    *   Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` to copy the formatted string to the clipboard.
    *   Update the `copiedPaletteName` state to provide visual feedback.
*   **Modified `Card` component:** The `onClick` handler on the `Card` component was commented out to prevent it from interfering with the copy button's click event. The `Card` can still be made active by clicking on other areas of the card if desired, but the primary interaction is now through the copy button.
*   **Added "Copy" button:** A new `button` element was added within each palette's `Card` component. This button:
    *   Triggers the `handleCopyPalette` function on click.
    *   Dynamically displays "Copy" or "Copied!" and the corresponding icon (`ClipboardCopy` or `Check`) based on the `copiedPaletteName` state.
    *   Includes styling to match the application's theme and provide visual feedback.

These changes enhance the user experience by providing a convenient way to quickly grab color palette information.
